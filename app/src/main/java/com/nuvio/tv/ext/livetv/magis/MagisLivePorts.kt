/**
 * The narrow ports the native-source adapters consume, declared next to the client that
 * implements them so the magis package never depends on the data package.
 *
 * - [MagisLiveCatalogApi]: the slice the catalog walk needs ([data.MagisChannelLoader]).
 * - [MagisLivePlaybackApi]: the slice playback needs ([data.MagisStreamResolver]).
 *
 * Both are deliberately minimal so tests can fake the portal without a session, a crypto stack or
 * a network. They are PUBLIC (while the implementing client stays internal) because the adapters
 * that consume them are public constructor surfaces — the Hilt graph cannot carry internal types.
